# Pre-Release QA Test Results - v0.26.0

## Test Execution Date: 2025-06-20

## Overall Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS

### Summary Statistics
- Total Tests Executed: ~50
- Tests Passed: 35
- Tests Failed: 5
- Tests with Issues: 10

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Context Generation Timeout ❌
- **Issue**: `pmat context` command consistently times out after 60s
- **Error**: "Analysis collection timed out after 60s"
- **Impact**: Core functionality unavailable
- **Root Cause**: Likely related to processing minified JS files (gridjs.min.js, d3.min.js, mermaid.min.js)

### 2. Complexity Analysis Not Detecting Functions ⚠️
- **Issue**: `pmat analyze complexity` reports 0 functions found
- **Expected**: Should detect Rust functions in the codebase
- **Impact**: Complexity metrics unavailable

### 3. Missing Output for Several Commands ⚠️
- **Issue**: Several commands produce no output:
  - `pmat analyze duplicates`
  - `pmat analyze graph-metrics`
  - `pmat analyze name-similarity`
  - `pmat analyze symbol-table`
  - `pmat quality-gate`
- **Impact**: Features appear non-functional

## Working Features ✅

### Successfully Tested:
1. **Basic Commands**
   - Version display (v0.26.0)
   - Help system
   - Command structure

2. **Git-based Analysis**
   - Code churn analysis
   - Multiple time periods
   - JSON output format

3. **Code Quality**
   - SATD detection (found 81 items)
   - TDG analysis
   - Big-O complexity analysis
   - Defect prediction
   - Proof annotations

4. **Build & Packaging**
   - Release binary builds successfully
   - Binary size: ~19.9MB
   - All language features included

5. **Error Handling**
   - Proper error messages for missing files
   - Handles invalid inputs gracefully

6. **Other Features**
   - Template listing
   - Report generation
   - Diagnostics (100% pass rate)
   - Makefile linting

## Recommendations

### High Priority Fixes:
1. **Fix context generation timeout** - Core feature broken
2. **Fix complexity analysis** - Not detecting any functions
3. **Investigate silent failures** - Multiple commands producing no output

### Medium Priority:
1. Review and fix argument parsing for several commands
2. Add better timeout handling for long-running operations
3. Exclude minified JS files from analysis by default

### Low Priority:
1. Improve error messages for invalid arguments
2. Add progress indicators for long operations

## Conclusion

The v0.26.0 release has significant functionality working, but critical issues with context generation and complexity analysis need to be resolved before release. The timeout issues appear to be related to processing large minified JavaScript files in the vendor directory.

### Release Decision: ❌ NOT READY

Critical functionality is broken. Fix the timeout and detection issues before proceeding with release.
