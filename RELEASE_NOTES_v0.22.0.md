  ```

### 🚀 Emit-Refactor Engine
Dual-mode refactoring system combining real-time defect emission with interactive refactoring capabilities.

- **Server Mode**: Real-time monitoring with <5ms latency
  ```bash
  pmat refactor serve --emit-threshold 15
  ```

- **Interactive Mode**: Agent-friendly JSON protocol
  ```bash
  pmat refactor interactive --target-complexity 20
  ```

- **Features**:
  - State machine-based refactoring workflow
  - Checkpoint/resume support
  - Multiple refactoring operations (Extract Function, Flatten Nesting, etc.)
  - Progress tracking and metrics
  - AI agent integration ready

### 📊 Excellence Tracker
Comprehensive code quality monitoring system tracking multiple dimensions of software excellence.

- **Metrics Tracked**:
  - Test coverage (line, branch, function)
  - Code complexity distribution
  - Type safety analysis
  - Documentation coverage
  - Performance metrics
  - Dependency health

- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  pmat excellence-tracker
  pmat excellence-tracker --format json --baseline baseline.json
  ```

### 📈 Technical Debt Gradient (TDG)
Quantitative metric measuring the rate of technical debt accumulation with predictive modeling.

- **Features**:
  - Multi-factor analysis (complexity, design, test, documentation, dependencies)
  - Time-decay modeling for aging debt
  - Risk level classification
  - Trend analysis and prediction
  - Remediation recommendations

- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  pmat analyze tdg
  pmat analyze tdg --predict 30 --confidence 95
  ```

### 🔍 Enhanced SATD Detection
Improved Self-Admitted Technical Debt detection with evolution tracking and team analytics.

- **New Features**:
  - Evolution tracking over time
  - Severity classification (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - Category analysis (Design/Implementation/Testing/Documentation/Performance)
  - Author and team analytics
  - Integration with CI/CD workflows

### 🤖 Provability Analysis
Lightweight formal verification for code correctness.

- **Features**:
  - Property domain analysis
