# Demonstrates the optimization for test execution

echo "üîç Test Optimization Demo"
echo "========================"
echo
echo "BEFORE (causes crashes):"
echo "  cargo test --release --workspace"
echo "  - Compiles in release mode: ~5-10 minutes"
echo "  - Uses all CPU cores for optimization"
echo "  - Runs 1000+ tests in parallel"
echo "  - Memory usage: 10-20GB"
echo
echo "AFTER (safe execution):"
echo "  cargo test --workspace -- --test-threads=4"
echo "  - Compiles in debug mode: ~30 seconds"
echo "  - Limited parallelism"
echo "  - Same test coverage"
echo "  - Memory usage: 2-4GB"
echo
echo "Additional optimizations:"
echo "1. Remove --release flag (10x faster compilation)"
echo "2. Limit test threads to 4 (prevent CPU overload)"
echo "3. Use debug mode for tests (release only for benchmarks)"
echo
echo "The root cause was NOT swap - it was the --release flag causing"
echo "massive memory usage during compilation optimization passes."
