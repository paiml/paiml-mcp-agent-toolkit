This directory contains permanent examples of assets generated by the MCP Agent Toolkit.

## Directory Structure

- `mermaid/` - Example Mermaid diagrams generated by the toolkit
- `templates/` - Example template files (Makefile, README, .gitignore) for each supported toolchain

## Purpose

These artifacts serve as:
1. **Living documentation** of what the toolkit produces
2. **Regression testing** examples to ensure output quality
3. **User examples** showing real-world usage
4. **Integration testing** fixtures for validation against external tools

All files in this directory are committed to version control to track changes in generated output over time.
