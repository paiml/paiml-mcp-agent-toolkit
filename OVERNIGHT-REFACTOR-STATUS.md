# Overnight Refactor Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed

### 1. **Refactor Serve Command Implementation**
- Added `refactor serve` subcommand to CLI
- Supports batch and interactive modes
- Handles JSON configuration files
- Implements checkpointing and resume functionality
- Includes auto-commit with customizable templates
- Runtime limiting and memory management

### 2. **State Machine Architecture**
```
ANALYZING → PLANNING → EXECUTING → VALIDATING
    ↑                                   ↓
    ←───────── REVERTING ←──────────────┘
```

### 3. **Scripts Created**
- `/scripts/overnight-refactor.sh` - Main orchestration script
- `/scripts/pre-release-analysis.sh` - Generates release checklist
- `/run-overnight-repair.sh` - Simple launcher script
- `/test-refactor-serve.sh` - Test script

### 4. **Configuration**
- `refactor-config.json` - Complete JSON configuration with:
  - State machine transitions
  - Complexity thresholds (cyclomatic: 10, cognitive: 15)
  - Refactoring operations (extract function, flatten nesting, etc.)
  - Validation commands (tests, lint, coverage)
  - Auto-commit templates

## 🔄 Current Status

### Working Components:
1. **CLI Command**: `pmat refactor serve` is implemented and compiles
2. **RefactorStateMachine**: State management with transitions
3. **UnifiedEngine**: Dual-mode support (batch/interactive)
4. **Configuration Loading**: JSON config parsing
5. **Checkpoint System**: Save/resume functionality

### Integration Points:
1. **AST Analysis**: Uses simplified metrics in `analyze_incremental`
2. **File Discovery**: Scans project directory for source files
3. **State Persistence**: Checkpoints saved to disk
4. **Git Integration**: Auto-commit functionality ready

## 📋 Usage

### Quick Start:
```bash
# Build the release binary
cargo build --release

# Run overnight repair
./run-overnight-repair.sh

# Or manually:
./target/release/pmat refactor serve \
  --config refactor-config.json \
  --project . \
  --checkpoint-dir .refactor_state \
  --max-runtime 43200
```

### Monitor Progress:
```bash
# Watch log
tail -f refactor_overnight.log

# Check state
cat .refactor_state/current_state.json

# View checklist
cat docs/bugs/prepare-release.md
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

The overnight refactor system is now implemented and ready to use. It will:
1. Analyze all source files for quality issues
2. Plan refactoring operations based on priorities
3. Execute transformations incrementally
4. Validate changes with tests
5. Auto-commit successful changes
6. Generate detailed reports

### To Run:
```bash
# Simple command to start overnight repair
./run-overnight-repair.sh
```

The system will run autonomously for up to 12 hours, fixing code quality issues while maintaining test coverage and build integrity.
