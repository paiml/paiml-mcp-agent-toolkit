## Quick Start

### Analyze Code Quality
```bash
# Generate comprehensive context analysis
pmat context

# Find complexity hotspots
pmat analyze complexity --max-cyclomatic 10

# Detect technical debt
pmat analyze satd

# Find the file with most lint violations (EXTREME quality mode)
pmat analyze lint-hotspot
```

### Refactor Code
```bash
# AI-powered automatic refactoring to achieve zero defects
pmat refactor auto

# Clean up documentation following Zero Tolerance standards
pmat refactor docs --dry-run

# Interactive refactoring mode
pmat refactor interactive
```

### Quality Gates
```bash
# Run all quality checks
pmat quality-gate --fail-on-violation

# Enforce extreme quality standards
pmat enforce extreme
```

## New in v0.26.1

### üßπ Documentation Cleanup (`pmat refactor docs`)
AI-assisted documentation cleanup that maintains Zero Tolerance Quality Standards:
- Identifies temporary files, outdated status reports, and build artifacts
- Interactive mode for reviewing files before removal
- Automatic backup before making changes
- Customizable patterns and preservation rules

Example:
```bash
# Dry run to see what would be removed
pmat refactor docs --dry-run

# Interactive mode
pmat refactor docs --format interactive

# Auto-remove with backup
pmat refactor docs --auto-remove --backup
```

### üî• EXTREME Quality Lint Analysis
The `lint-hotspot` command now uses the strictest possible quality standards by default:
```bash
# Runs with: -D warnings -D clippy::pedantic -D clippy::nursery -D clippy::cargo
pmat analyze lint-hotspot
```

## Zero Tolerance Quality Standards

This project follows strict quality standards:
- **ZERO SATD**: No TODO, FIXME, HACK, or placeholder implementations
- **ZERO High Complexity**: No function exceeds cyclomatic complexity of 20
- **ZERO Known Defects**: All code must be fully functional
- **ZERO Incomplete Features**: Only complete, tested features are merged
