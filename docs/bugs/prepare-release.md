# Release Preparation Checklist - v0.22.0

Generated: Mon Jun  9 10:37:37 AM EDT 2025
Analysis Type: Comprehensive Pre-Release Audit

## Executive Summary

This automated analysis identifies all quality issues that must be addressed before release.
The system enforces ZERO tolerance for SATD, high complexity, and known defects.

---

## 🔴 Critical Issues (Release Blockers)

### Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD)
**Policy**: ZERO tolerance - No TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX allowed

```
No SATD found
```
✅ **SATD Check Passed** - No technical debt markers found

### High Complexity Functions
**Policy**: No function may exceed cyclomatic complexity of 20

```
No functions exceed complexity threshold
```

### Incomplete Features
**Policy**: All features must be fully implemented

```bash
No unimplemented!() calls found
```

### Test Status

❌ **Tests failing** - See test output for details

### Linting Status

✅ **Linting passed** - No warnings or errors

---

## 🟡 High Priority Issues

### Functions with Complexity 15-20

```
No functions in this range
```

### Dead Code Analysis

```
Dead code analysis not available

## 🤖 Automated Refactoring Commands

To fix identified issues automatically, run:

```bash
# Fix SATD markers
pmat refactor interactive --fix-satd

# Extract complex functions
pmat refactor interactive --extract-complex --threshold 20

# Remove dead code
pmat refactor interactive --remove-dead-code

# Run full overnight repair
./scripts/overnight-refactor.sh
```

## 📈 Quality Metrics Trend

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| SATD Count | TBD | 0 | 🔄 |
| Max Complexity | TBD | 20 | 🔄 |
| Test Coverage | TBD | >80% | 🔄 |
| Lint Warnings | TBD | 0 | 🔄 |
| Binary Size | ~15MB | <20MB | ✅ |
