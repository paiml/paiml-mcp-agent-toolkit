# Top Files Enhancement Report

## Summary

This document summarizes the work done to fix the major defect where analyze sub-commands do not print top 10 files by default.

## Completed Commands

The following analyze commands have been fixed to show top files:

1. **analyze complexity** - Shows "Top Files by Complexity" sorted by total complexity score
2. **analyze churn** - Shows "Top Files by Churn" sorted by commit count and churn score  
3. **analyze dag** - Already working correctly (shows visualization)
4. **analyze dead-code** - Already had formatting support, verified working
5. **analyze satd** - Shows "Top Files with SATD" sorted by SATD item count
6. **analyze lint-hotspot** - Shows "Top Files with Lint Issues" sorted by defect density
7. **analyze deep-context** - Shows "Top Files by Complexity" with weighted scoring
8. **analyze tdg** - Already had top_files support in stub implementation
9. **analyze provability** - Shows "Top Files by Provability" with average scores per file
10. **analyze duplicates** - Shows "Top Files by Duplication" sorted by duplication percentage
11. **analyze defect-prediction** - Shows "Top Files by Defect Risk" with risk scores
12. **analyze comprehensive** - Fixed to use real handler with "Top 10 Hotspot Files"

## Remaining Commands

The following commands still need to be updated:

- analyze graph-metrics
- analyze name-similarity  
- analyze proof-annotations
- analyze incremental-coverage
- analyze symbol-table
- analyze big-o
- analyze assembly-script
- analyze web-assembly

## Implementation Pattern

For each command, the fix typically involves:

1. Adding a section like "## Top Files by [Metric]" to the output
2. Sorting files by the relevant metric (descending)
3. Showing top 10 files by default (or use --top-files parameter)
4. Including relevant metrics for each file
5. Adding a doctest to verify the formatting

## Technical Debt Identified

1. Many analyze commands are still using stub implementations
2. The SATD detector doesn't catch "stub" or "placeholder" patterns
3. Some commands delegate to stubs instead of real implementations
4. Inconsistent output formatting across different analyze commands

## Recommendations

1. Replace all stub implementations with real analyzers
2. Enhance SATD detector to catch stub/placeholder patterns
3. Standardize output format across all analyze commands
4. Add integration tests for top files functionality
5. Consider creating a shared formatting utility for top files display
