# CLI Refactor Completion Specification

## Overview
This document tracks the completion of the CLI refactoring work required to achieve 80% test coverage. Currently, the system has 184 modified files with extensive stub implementations blocking full test coverage.

**Current Status**: 42.30% coverage (Target: 80%)
**Critical Path**: Add unit tests for newly implemented functions to reach 80% coverage

## Test Coverage Results (2025-01-11)
üìä **Coverage Analysis Completed:**
- Overall coverage: 42.30% (8,661/20,476 lines covered)
- Gap from target: 37.70% (need to cover 7,720 more lines for 80%)
- Main areas needing coverage:
  - CLI handlers and dispatching
  - Demo adapters
  - Error handling paths
  - Newly implemented stub functions

## Performance Issues Identified
‚ö†Ô∏è **Context Command Performance:**
- Issue: Context command times out on large projects due to repeated churn analysis
- Root cause: DeepContextAnalyzer runs churn analysis multiple times (once per file/component)
- Fix applied: Removed expensive analyses (Churn, Provability) from context generation
- Status: Fix needs compilation to take effect

## Testing Validation Criteria

### Coverage Targets
- [ ] **CLI Module**: From 0.33% to >70% coverage
- [ ] **Handlers**: From <5% to >60% coverage  
- [ ] **Services Integration**: From 22.76% to >50% coverage
- [ ] **Overall**: From 47.71% to 80%+ coverage

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Zero Compilation Errors**: `cargo check` passes cleanly
- [ ] **Zero Test Failures**: `cargo test --lib` passes 100%
- [ ] **Zero Stub Functions**: No "not yet implemented" messages
- [ ] **Zero Placeholder Code**: No `json!({"status": "placeholder"})` responses
- [ ] **Performance**: Analysis operations complete within reasonable time (<30s for medium projects)

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Service Integration Complexity** - Many stubs depend on complex service orchestration
   - Mitigation: Implement mocks first, then real services
   
2. **Performance Impact** - Full implementations may be slower than stubs
   - Mitigation: Add timeout handling and progress reporting
   
3. **Breaking Changes** - Stub removal may break existing integrations
   - Mitigation: Maintain backward compatibility in APIs

### Rollback Plan
- Keep stub implementations as `_legacy` functions during transition
- Implement feature flags to switch between stub and real implementations
- Maintain separate test suites for stub vs. real implementations

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Test coverage: 47.71% ‚Üí 80%+
- [ ] Passing tests: Current ‚Üí 100% pass rate
- [ ] CLI coverage: 0.33% ‚Üí 70%+
- [ ] Handler coverage: <5% ‚Üí 60%+

### Qualitative  
- [ ] All analysis commands produce real output (not placeholder messages)
- [ ] Protocol adapters work with real data
- [ ] Error handling is graceful and informative
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for typical projects

## Dependencies & Blockers

### Service Dependencies
- Complexity analysis service (exists, needs integration)
- Dead code analyzer (exists, needs integration)  
- DAG builder service (exists, needs integration)
- Git analysis service (exists, needs integration)

## Completion Timeline

**Target**: 4 weeks for 80% coverage
- **Week 1**: Core functionality + compilation fixes
- **Week 2**: Quality analysis features  
- **Week 3**: Advanced analysis features
- **Week 4**: Protocol integration + final polish

**Critical Path**: Complete Phase 1 before starting Phase 2, as later phases depend on core infrastructure.
