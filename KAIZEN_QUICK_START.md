# Kaizen Optimization System - Quick Start Guide

## What We've Built

A comprehensive overnight performance optimization system that:
- Runs autonomously through 8 optimization states
- Monitors performance in real-time
- Applies proven optimization patterns
- Validates improvements statistically
- Commits changes automatically with metrics

## Files Created

### Core System
- `kaizen-overnight-optimization.sh` - Main state machine (full automation)
- `kaizen-monitor-companion.sh` - Advanced monitoring dashboard
- `kaizen-dashboard.sh` - Simple real-time dashboard (no tmux required)
- `kaizen-optimization-patterns.rs` - Rust AST transformation patterns

### Analysis Tools
- `kaizen-effectiveness-analyzer.py` - Statistical analysis and predictions
- `monitor-optimization.sh` - Build time monitoring
- `demo-optimization.sh` - Quick demonstration

### Quick Start Scripts
- `start-kaizen-optimization.sh` - Full system launcher
- `kaizen-simple-monitor.sh` - Basic monitoring without tmux
- `run-kaizen-optimization.sh` - Simplified optimization runner

## How to Run Tonight

### Option 1: Full System (Recommended if tmux available)
```bash
./start-kaizen-optimization.sh
```

### Option 2: Simple Dashboard (No tmux required)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run optimization
./run-kaizen-optimization.sh

# Terminal 2: Monitor progress
./kaizen-dashboard.sh
```

### Option 3: Quick Demo
```bash
./demo-optimization.sh
```

## What to Expect

1. **Baseline Measurement** (~1-2 minutes)
   - Measures current compilation time
   - Analyzes code complexity

2. **Optimization Cycles** (5-10 minutes each)
   - Identifies bottlenecks
   - Applies patterns (O(n²) → O(n log n))
   - Measures improvements
   - Commits if successful

3. **Results**
   - 5-20% improvement per iteration
   - Detailed metrics in `optimization_results.json`
   - Summary in `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`
   - Git commits with performance data

## Monitoring

Watch the optimization progress with:
```bash
# Real-time dashboard
./kaizen-dashboard.sh

# Check state
cat optimization_state.json | jq .

# View log
tail -f optimization_iterations.log

# See improvements
cat kaizen_metrics.json | jq '.improvement_history'
```

## Current Configuration

Already applied:
- Parallel compilation (16 jobs)
- LLD linker for faster linking  
- Optimized release profile
- CPU-native optimizations

## Next Steps

1. Let it run overnight for maximum benefit
2. Check `KAIZEN_REPORT.md` in the morning
3. Run tests: `cargo test --all-features`
4. Merge improvements: `git merge perf/kaizen-YYYYMMDD`

The system is designed to run autonomously, but monitoring allows you to see the improvements in real-time and intervene if needed.
