## üìä Key Technical Insights

### Symbolic vs Statistical AI Comparison
| **Symbolic (This System)** | **Statistical/Neural** |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| `if branches > 10 then complex` | `P(complex\|features) = 0.87` |
| `V(G) = E - N + 2P` (exact) | `complexity ‚âà f(embeddings)` |
| Deterministic AST parsing | Probabilistic token prediction |
| Rule: "TODO = tech debt" | Learned pattern from corpus |

### Performance Characteristics
```rust
// Parallel symbolic computation - no gradient dependencies
let chunks: Vec<_> = files.par_chunks(128)
    .map(|chunk| analyze_symbolic(chunk))  // Embarrassingly parallel
    .collect();

// Exact complexity: O(n) parsing, O(V+E) graph algorithms  
// No training time, no model loading, no GPU requirements
```
