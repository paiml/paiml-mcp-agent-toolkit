# Optimization Summary

## Test System Issues Resolved

### Root Cause
The test crashes were caused by the `--release` flag in the Makefile's `test-fast` target. This flag:
- Forces full release optimization during compilation
- Uses all CPU cores for optimization passes
- Consumes 10-20GB of memory for link-time optimization (LTO)
- Takes 5-10 minutes vs 30 seconds for debug builds

### Solution Applied
Removed `--release` flag from test commands in Makefile. Tests now:
- Compile in debug mode (fast, low memory)
- Use limited parallelism (4 threads)
- Complete without system crashes

### Coverage Status
Current: **47.79%** (Target: 80%)

To reach 80% coverage, need comprehensive integration tests for:
1. CLI command handlers (10,000+ lines of untested code)
2. Protocol service implementation
3. Demo server functionality
4. Cache persistence layer

The simple unit tests added only provided minimal coverage increase. Full integration tests with actual file I/O and command execution are needed for meaningful coverage improvement.
