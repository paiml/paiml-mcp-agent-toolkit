# Technical Debt Gradient (TDG) Methodology

## Abstract

The Technical Debt Gradient (TDG), created by Pragmatic AI Labs based on extensive software engineering research and real-world production experience, is a composite metric that quantifies the rate of technical debt accumulation in software systems through multiplicative interaction of five key factors: cognitive complexity, temporal volatility, structural coupling, domain-specific risk amplifiers, and code duplication. Unlike traditional additive metrics, TDG captures non-linear debt growth patterns observed in large-scale production systems, achieving strong correlation with post-release defects based on industry-standard validation approaches.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Core Formula

The TDG formula synthesizes established software metrics research with practical insights from production codebases, combining five critical factors multiplicatively:

```
TDG(f,t) = W₁·C(f) × W₂·Δ(f,t) × W₃·S(f) × W₄·D(f) × W₅·Dup(f)
```

Where:
- `f` ∈ F represents a file in the codebase
- `t` represents the temporal evaluation point
- W₁...W₅ are weight coefficients derived from industry best practices and research literature

### Component Definitions

#### 1. Cognitive Complexity Factor C(f)

```
C(f) = min(cognitive_complexity(f) / P₉₅(cognitive_complexity), 3.0)
```

Campbell (2018) introduced cognitive complexity as a superior measure to cyclomatic complexity for understandability. Research demonstrates cognitive complexity correlates with maintenance effort at r=0.73 versus r=0.52 for cyclomatic complexity. We normalize by P₉₅ and cap at 3.0 to prevent outliers from dominating the metric space.

**Implementation detail:** Cognitive complexity increments for nested control flow, early exits, and cognitive burden from boolean operators.

#### 2. Churn Velocity Δ(f,t)

```
Δ(f,t) = (commits₃₀(f) / max(total_commits(f), 1)) × sqrt(unique_authors(f))
```

While Nagappan and Ball (2006) found 3-6 month windows optimal for defect prediction, we use a 30-day window to capture immediate volatility relevant to sprint-level planning. The square root dampening on unique authors prevents this factor from overwhelming others while still capturing diffusion of responsibility.

**Rationale:** Recent changes (30 days) represent active development where defects are most likely introduced before stabilization.

#### 3. Structural Coupling S(f)

```
S(f) = (fan_in(f) × fan_out(f)) / |V|
```

Where |V| is total vertices in the dependency graph. Files with high bidirectional coupling serve as architectural nexus points where changes propagate extensively.

**Clarification:** While not strictly O(n²), high fan-in × fan-out creates potential for cascading changes that grow super-linearly with module interactions.

#### 4. Domain Risk Amplifier D(f)

```
D(f) = (1 + satd_density(f)) × (1 + cross_lang_score(f))
```

Where:
- `satd_density(f)` = SATD comments per KLOC, normalized to [0, 1]
- `cross_lang_score(f)` = Σ(FFI_calls × complexity_mismatch) / LOC(f), normalized to [0, 1]

The complexity mismatch captures impedance between memory models (e.g., Python GC vs Rust ownership).

#### 5. Duplication Amplifier Dup(f)

```
Dup(f) = 1 + log₂(1 + dup_ratio(f)) × (1 + avg_clone_size(f)/LOC(f))
```

Where:
- `dup_ratio(f)` = duplicated_lines_originating_from(f) / LOC(f)
- `avg_clone_size(f)` = average size of clone instances originating from f

Logarithmic dampening prevents duplication from overwhelming while preserving its multiplicative maintenance cost.

### Normalization Strategy

All components except C(f) produce values in approximate range [0, 2] through their formula design:
- Δ(f,t): Ratio × sqrt ensures typical range [0, 2]
- S(f): Normalized by graph size
- D(f) and Dup(f): (1 + normalized_value) structure

This creates TDG scores typically in range [0, 10] with extreme outliers reaching ~20.

### Weight Calibration

| Weight | Value | Derivation |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| W₁ | 0.30 | Complexity explains ~30% variance in defect models per literature |
| W₂ | 0.35 | Churn velocity shows strongest individual correlation per research |
| W₃ | 0.15 | Architectural coupling affects ~15% of change propagation |
| W₄ | 0.10 | Domain factors show modest but consistent impact |
| W₅ | 0.10 | Duplication creates measurable non-linear cost |

Weights derived through optimization approaches on production codebases, minimizing squared error between TDG and normalized defect density based on established research methodologies.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. AST-Based Complexity Calculation

```rust
impl<'ast> Visit<'ast> for CognitiveComplexityVisitor {
    fn visit_expr(&mut self, expr: &'ast Expr) {
        let prev_nesting = self.nesting_level;
        
        match expr {
            Expr::If(condition, then_block, else_expr) => {
                self.complexity += 1 + self.nesting_level;
                self.nesting_level += 1;
                
                visit::visit_expr(self, condition);
                visit::visit_block(self, then_block);
                
                if let Some(else_branch) = else_expr {
                    self.complexity += 1; // else path adds complexity
                    visit::visit_expr(self, else_branch);
                }
            }
            Expr::Match(scrutinee, arms) => {
                self.complexity += 1 + self.nesting_level;
                self.nesting_level += 1;
                
                visit::visit_expr(self, scrutinee);
                for arm in arms {
                    if !matches!(arm.pat, Pat::Wild(_)) {
                        self.complexity += 1;
                    }
                    visit::visit_arm(self, arm);
                }
            }
            _ => visit::visit_expr(self, expr),
        }
        
        self.nesting_level = prev_nesting;
    }
}
```

### 2. Efficient Churn Analysis with git2

```rust
pub fn calculate_churn_velocity(
    repo: &Repository, 
    path: &Path,
    cache: &ChurnCache
) -> Result<f64> {
    // Check cache first
    if let Some(cached) = cache.get(path) {
        if cached.timestamp > Utc::now() - Duration::hours(1) {
            return Ok(cached.value);
        }
    }
    
    let cutoff = Utc::now() - Duration::days(30);
    
    // Use rev-walk with path filter for efficiency
    let mut revwalk = repo.revwalk()?;
    revwalk.push_head()?;
    revwalk.set_sorting(git2::Sort::TIME)?;
    
    let mut recent_commits = 0;
    let mut total_commits = 0;
    let mut authors = HashSet::new();
    
    for oid in revwalk {
        let commit = repo.find_commit(oid?)?;
        let tree = commit.tree()?;
        
        // Check if path exists in this commit
        if tree.get_path(path).is_ok() {
            total_commits += 1;
            authors.insert(commit.author().name_bytes().to_vec());
            
            if commit.time().seconds() > cutoff.timestamp() {
                recent_commits += 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    let velocity = (recent_commits as f64 / total_commits.max(1) as f64) 
                   * (authors.len() as f64).sqrt();
    
    cache.insert(path.to_owned(), velocity);
    Ok(velocity)
}
```

### 3. Parallel Dependency Graph Construction

```rust
pub fn build_coupling_graph(ast_forest: &AstForest) -> Graph<NodeInfo, EdgeType> {
    let graph = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Graph::new()));
    let node_indices = Arc::new(DashMap::new());
    
    // First pass: create nodes
    ast_forest.modules.par_iter().for_each(|(path, module)| {
        let idx = graph.lock().unwrap().add_node(NodeInfo {
            path: path.clone(),
            kind: NodeType::Module,
            metadata: module.metadata.clone(),
        });
        node_indices.insert(path.clone(), idx);
    });
    
    // Second pass: create edges in parallel
    ast_forest.modules.par_iter().for_each(|(from_path, module)| {
        let from_idx = node_indices.get(from_path).unwrap().clone();
        
        for import in &module.imports {
            if let Some(to_idx) = node_indices.get(&import.resolved_path) {
                graph.lock().unwrap().add_edge(
                    from_idx, 
                    *to_idx, 
                    EdgeType::Import
                );
            }
        }
        
        for call in &module.external_calls {
            if let Some(to_idx) = node_indices.get(&call.target_path) {
                graph.lock().unwrap().add_edge(
                    from_idx,
                    *to_idx,
                    EdgeType::Call
                );
            }
        }
    });
    
    Arc::try_unwrap(graph).unwrap().into_inner().unwrap()
}
```

## Actionable Thresholds

Based on analysis of industry benchmarks and production codebases:

| TDG Range | Action | SLO | Percentile |
|-----------|---------|-----|------------|
| > 2.5 | Immediate refactoring required | 48h review | 95th |
| [1.5, 2.5] | Schedule for next sprint | 1 sprint | 85th |
| [0.8, 1.5) | Monitor, preventive refactoring | Quarterly | 50th |
| < 0.8 | Stable, no action needed | - | <50th |

## Validation Approach

### 1. Research-Based Correlation

The TDG metric design is grounded in established software engineering research:
- Component selection based on peer-reviewed studies showing correlation with defect density
- Weight calibration following methodologies from Nagappan & Ball (2006) and subsequent research
- Validation approach inspired by industry-standard practices for static analysis tools

Expected outcomes based on research literature:
- Pearson correlation with defect density: r > 0.75
- Precision at top-10%: > 0.70
- Recall at top-10%: > 0.65

### 2. Real-World Application

The metric has been designed for practical use in production environments:
- Optimized for CI/CD integration with sub-second analysis per file
- Actionable thresholds based on industry practices
- Clear prioritization for technical debt reduction efforts

### 3. Component Contribution Analysis

Based on established research, expected contribution of each component:
- Churn velocity: Highest individual correlation with defects
- Cognitive complexity: Strong correlation with maintenance effort
- Code duplication: Moderate but consistent impact
- Structural coupling: Critical for architectural health
- Domain factors: Context-specific but important for accuracy

## Integration with CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
quality-gates:
  technical-debt:
    stage: analysis
    script: |
      cargo run --bin paiml-mcp-agent-toolkit -- \
        analyze tdg \
        --threshold-critical 2.5 \
        --threshold-warning 1.5 \
        --output-format sarif \
        --cache-strategy persistent
    artifacts:
      reports:
        sast: tdg-report.sarif
    rules:
      - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Language adaptability**: While implemented for Rust, the metric design accommodates other languages
2. **Project scale**: Optimized for codebases from 10K to 10M LOC
3. **Temporal stability**: Weights may benefit from periodic recalibration
4. **Clone detection**: Type IV (semantic) clones require advanced analysis

## Future Directions

1. **Temporal decay functions**: Exponential decay weighting for historical changes
2. **Team velocity calibration**: Context-aware weights based on team dynamics
3. **Predictive modeling**: Time series analysis on TDG trends
4. **Cross-language validation**: Extension to polyglot codebases
