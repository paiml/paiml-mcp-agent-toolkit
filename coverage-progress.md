# Coverage Progress Report

## Current Status: 47.71% (Target: 80%)

### Summary
- **Lines**: 54,237 total, 28,363 missed (47.71% covered)
- **Functions**: 4,533 total, 2,364 missed (47.85% covered)
- **Regions**: 23,584 total, 14,024 missed (40.54% covered)

### Areas Needing Improvement

#### Critical Low Coverage Areas (<10%):
1. **CLI Module** (0.33% coverage)
   - `cli/mod.rs`: 7,353 lines, only 24 covered
   - All CLI handlers have <5% coverage
   - Command dispatcher and structure need tests

2. **Unified Protocol Service** (22.76% coverage)
   - `unified_protocol/service.rs`: 659 lines, 509 missed
   - Protocol adapters need integration tests

3. **Binary Entry Point** (0% coverage)
   - `bin/pmat.rs`: 80 lines, 0 covered
   - Main binary needs integration tests

4. **Demo Module** (0.75% - 16.53% coverage)
   - Demo server, runner, and router have minimal coverage
   - Protocol harness at 48.27% is better but needs work

5. **Cache Persistence** (0% coverage)
   - `services/cache/persistent.rs`: 310 lines, all missed
   - Persistent cache manager needs tests

### Well-Covered Areas (>90%):
- `services/complexity.rs`: 98.41%
- `services/duplicate_detector.rs`: 96.53%
- `services/satd_detector.rs`: 96.82%
- `services/makefile_linter/`: >90% across all modules
- `services/ranking.rs`: 97.22%
- `services/quality_gates.rs`: 93.91%

### Action Plan to Reach 80%:

1. **Add CLI Integration Tests** (Potential +15-20%)
   - Test all command handlers
   - Test argument parsing
   - Test command dispatch logic

2. **Add Binary Integration Tests** (Potential +5%)
   - Test main entry point
   - Test protocol detection
   - Test initialization

3. **Add Protocol Service Tests** (Potential +10%)
   - Test unified protocol service
   - Test adapter integration
   - Test request/response flow

4. **Add Demo Module Tests** (Potential +5%)
   - Test demo server endpoints
   - Test export functionality
   - Test configuration loading

5. **Add Cache Persistence Tests** (Potential +3%)
   - Test SQLite cache operations
   - Test cache expiration
   - Test concurrent access

### Next Steps:
To achieve 80% coverage, focus on:
1. CLI module tests (highest impact)
2. Protocol service tests
3. Binary integration tests
4. Demo module tests

These four areas alone could increase coverage by ~35-40%, bringing total coverage to ~82-87%.
