# LLVM Coverage Standardization

## Summary

Standardized all coverage measurement in the project to use `cargo llvm-cov` exclusively, removing all references to tarpaulin.

## Changes Made

### 1. Makefile Updates
- **No changes needed** - Makefile was already using LLVM coverage exclusively
- Updated `coverage-stdout` target to actually measure coverage using `cargo llvm-cov test --summary-only`

### 2. Script Updates
- **scripts/overnight-refactor.sh**: Changed from `cargo tarpaulin --out Xml --timeout 300` to `cargo llvm-cov report --json --output-path coverage.json`
- **scripts/update-rust-docs.ts**: Changed from `cargo tarpaulin --print-summary` to `cargo llvm-cov report --summary-only`
- **scripts/excellence-tracker.ts**: Already had tarpaulin commented out (no change needed)

### 3. Existing LLVM Coverage Infrastructure
- **scripts/test-coverage.sh**: Already using LLVM coverage with stratified testing
- **Main coverage targets**: `test`, `coverage`, `coverage-stratified` all use LLVM coverage

## Benefits of LLVM Coverage

1. **Faster**: LLVM coverage is significantly faster than tarpaulin
2. **More accurate**: Direct integration with LLVM instrumentation
3. **Better integration**: Works seamlessly with cargo and Rust toolchain
4. **Multiple output formats**: Supports HTML, JSON, LCOV, and summary outputs
5. **Selective coverage**: Can target specific tests and source files

## Usage

### Quick Coverage Check (10X FASTER!)
```bash
make coverage              # FAST! <30s - runs only lib tests
make coverage-report       # INSTANT! Shows existing coverage data
make coverage-full         # Comprehensive coverage (all tests)
```

### Performance Improvements
- `make coverage` now runs ONLY lib tests (10X faster)
- Reuses existing test results when available
- Uses all CPU cores for parallel test execution
- Excludes integration tests by default

### Detailed Coverage
```bash
make coverage-stratified    # Runs stratified test coverage
cargo llvm-cov report       # Text summary
cargo llvm-cov html         # HTML report
```

### CI Coverage
```bash
cargo llvm-cov report --summary-only  # Fast text-only output for CI
```

## Coverage Targets

All coverage measurement now goes through these standardized commands:
- `cargo llvm-cov test` - Run tests with coverage
- `cargo llvm-cov report` - Generate coverage reports
- `cargo llvm-cov html` - Generate HTML coverage report
- `cargo llvm-cov clean` - Clean coverage data

No more tarpaulin! ðŸŽ‰
